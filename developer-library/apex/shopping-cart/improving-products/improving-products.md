    ![](images/products-page.png " ")

*Please note that customer can easily identify the products that already has added to the shopping cart.*

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Improve both Faceted Search and Cards region. 
- Add Dynamic Actions to the page.

## Task 1: Adding New Facets
In the Runtime environment navigate to Products, this is the page where your customers can explore the products and select what they wish to buy.
As you can see, it's hard to find the products and it would be beneficial to see additional details related to the products.

![](images/products-page.png " ")

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the Products page in Page Designer.

    Given you ran this app from the APEX App Builder, a Developer Toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the screen. 
    *{Note: End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.}*

    In the Developer Toolbar click **Edit Page 1**.

    ![](images/dev-toolbar.png " ")
    
    Alternatively, you can also navigate back to the APEX App Builder tab in your browser manually by selecting the appropriate browser tab or window.   
    Once in the App Builder click **1 - Products**.

    ![](images/alt-app-builder.png " ")
    
    You should now be in Page Designer with **Page 1: Products** loaded.

    You need to add three new facets to the Products page:
    - DEPARTMENT
    - CLOTHING
    - COLOR

2. Within Page Designer, in the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to Facets under **Search** Faceted Search.
3. Right click on Facets and click **Create Facet**.

    ![](images/create-facet.png " ")

4. In the Property Editor, enter the following:
    - Name - enter **P1\_DEPARTMENT\_ID**
    - Type - select **Checkbox Group**
    - Label - **Department**
    - Under List of Values section:
        - Type - select **Shared Component**
        - List of Values - select **DEPARTMENT_LOOKUP.DEPARTMENT**

    ![](images/department-facet.png " ")
    
5. Create the second facet. Right click on Facets and click **Create Facet**.

    In the Property Editor, enter the following:
    - Name - enter **P1\_CLOTHING\_ID**
    - Type - select **Checkbox Group**
    - Label - **Clothing**
    - Under List of Values section:
        - Type - select **Shared Component**
        - List of Values - select **CLOTHING_LOOKUP.CLOTHING**

        - List of Values - select **COLOR_LOOKUP.COLOR**

    ![](images/color-facet.png " ")

## Task 2: Reorder Facets
Unit price is not a common search criteria, so you want to put this facet at the bottom.

1. In the Rendering tree (left pane), under Search, within Facets, click and hold **P1\_UNIT\_PRICE** and drag it up until it is under **P1\_COLOR\_ID** then release the mouse.

    ![](images/reorder-facet.png " ")

## Task 7: Run Products Page 

When running products page, you will notice that Department, Clothing and Color facets don't have values as the products are not associated with the corresponding characteristic.

For that, navigate to **Manage Products** Page, upload a picture and select the proper color, department and clothing characteristic for each product.
    ![](images/manage-products.png " ")
